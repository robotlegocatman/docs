# Special cloud behaviors

:::info
This page is about the [TurboWarp Packager](https://turbowarp.org/).
:::

The disabled-by-default "Special cloud behaviors" option changes the behavior of specifically named cloud variables to unlock new compatibilities for your project. This is based on a [similar feature in HTMLifier](https://github.com/SheepTester/htmlifier/wiki/Special-cloud-behaviours). This feature can be enabled in the "Cloud variables" section.

To make these, just create a cloud variable as you normally would but give them the specific name found below. For example, to use the `☁ url` variable, create a variable named `url` and mark it as a cloud variable.

Enabling special cloud behaviors will override any other settings for these variables, so a variable like `☁ username` will never be stored locally or synced with other users.

## ☁ url {#url}

The value of `☁ url` will be set to the page's current URL. Changing the value of `☁ url` does nothing.

## ☁ redirect {#redirect}

When the value of `☁ redirect` is set to a URL, the current tab will navigate to that URL.

## ☁ open link {#open-link}

When the value of `☁ open link` is set to a URL, the project will attempt to open a new tab with that URL open. Note that this isn't always reliable due to the popup blockers built in to most browsers.

## ☁ username {#username}

When the value of `☁ username` is changed, the value of the `username` block in the sensing category will change.

## ☁ pasted {#pasted}

When the user pastes some text onto the page using a shortcut like ctrl+v, the text is stored in `☁ pasted`.

## ☁ set clipboard {#set-clipboard}

When the value of `☁ set clipboard` is changed, the page will try to store the text in the user's clipboard. 
:::warning
Disclaimer, this might not always work depending on the OS the user running the project has.

## ☁ room id {#room-id}

When the value of `☁ room id` is changed, the project ID used for syncronizing cloud variables is changed. For example, if the project's original ID is 1234 and `☁ room id` is set to `xyz`, the new project ID will be `1234-xyz`. To reset the project ID to the original ID, set the value of `☁ room id` to an empty string.

This can be useful as a way to add a server selector to cloud variable projects without having to create a bunch of extra variables. Only people with the same room ID will have variables synced between them. It could take a couple seconds for cloud variables to begin working again as it has to reconnect to the cloud variable server.

The room ID does not affect locally stored cloud variables.

## ☁ eval {#eval}

:::warning
This option requires "Unsafe special cloud behaviors" to be enabled.

Unsafe cloud behaviors allows the packaged project to execute arbitrary code outside of the "sandbox" that projects are typically executed in. Depending on the environment you're packaging for, this grants projects full control over your computer, including the ability to install viruses.

If you do not trust the project you're packaging or don't make use of this feature, please turn off this option.
:::

When the value of `☁ eval` is changed, its value will be evaluated as JavaScript.

If the JavaScript is successfully evaluated, its output will be stored in `☁ eval output`.

If there was an error evaluating the JavaScript, the error will be stored in `☁ eval error`.

If the JavaScript returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), it will store the resolved value in `☁ eval output` if the promise resolves, or the error in `☁ eval error` if it rejects. Note that setting `☁ eval` is always an instant process, so the output variables may not update immediately.
